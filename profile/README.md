# 🚀 SoloSafe - Research on Offline Asset Transfers 🔒

**SoloSafe** is a research-driven project that explores **offline asset transfers** using cutting-edge cryptographic techniques like **Zero Knowledge Proofs** (ZKPs) and decentralized technologies built on **Starknet**.

The project enables **peer-to-peer asset transfers** without requiring an internet connection. SoloSafe leverages **WiFi Hotspot** and **Bluetooth** technology for communication, creating a novel approach for securely transferring assets in environments with no internet access. 🔗📶

## 🌟 Features

- ⚡ **Zero Knowledge Proofs**: Secure transfers without exposing sensitive data.
- 📡 **Offline Transactions**: Transfers that can happen in the absence of internet, using WiFi or Bluetooth.
- 🧑‍💻 **Starknet Integration**: Built on top of **Starknet** with scalability and security in mind through zk-rollups.
- 🛡️ **Secure Asset Transfers**: Ensure privacy and integrity even in offline environments.
- 📱 **Mobile-first** design for **Android**, **iOS**, and **KaiOS** devices.

## 🛠️ Architecture

The core idea of SoloSafe involves multiple layers, including **Zero Knowledge Proofs**, peer-to-peer communication protocols, and a decentralized architecture powered by Starknet. Below is a high-level visual representation:

## 📡 Peer-to-Peer Transaction Workflow

	1.	WiFi Hotspot or Bluetooth: Devices connect without the need for internet.
	2.	QR Code: Exchange information between sender and receiver securely.
	3.	Zero Knowledge Proofs: Assets are transferred, maintaining privacy and security.
	4.	Starknet: The transaction is finalized using zk-rollups when back online.
